            <hr>

            <p>Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are an extremely friendly
                and loyal breed. They are a popular family dog and good with young children
                and other animals. Small in size, they do well even in apartments. They are also
                good companions for traveling and outdoor activies such as hiking and camping.

        <h2>My Dog</h2>
        <hr>

        <section id="my-dog">

            <p>My first dog was a Cavalier Spaniel
                named Sampson (or Sammy for short). He was of the Blenheim
                color variety which are <b>reddish-brown</b> and white.
            </p>

            <p>I chose Cavalier King Charles Spaniels as my theme since Sammy made
                a big impact on me as my first dog.
                <p>
                    I had always wanted a dog
                    growing up and wasn't allowed to have one until I was fifteen years
                    old. I did a lot of research trying to find the perfect dog and
                    happened to choose Cavaliers. A neighbor of mine happened to own
                    several Cavaliers, so that also helped me make a decision. </p>

                <p>Finding
                    a breeder wasn't easy, and the process of locating one and waiting
                    for available puppies took several months. I was very happy to finally
                    bring home my puppy.</p>

                <p>Even though Sammy did not
                    end up living a very long life, I am still glad I made the decision to
                    raise a Cavalier. I would like to do so again in the future.
                </p>
