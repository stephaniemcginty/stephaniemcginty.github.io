        <p>My name is Stephanie. I am currently a student at Bellevue College and
            taking the Prog109 Intro to Web Development course. </p>

        <p>This is my first
            tech-related course - which I am enjoying so far. I have had minimal experience with
            coding, and am learning much more from taking this course. I plan on earning a degree in Information
            Systems
            and Technology.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy being outside, hiking, reading, watching movies, and playing with my puppy.</p>
