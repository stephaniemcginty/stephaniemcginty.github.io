            <p>Sammy (Sampson) was my first dog. I purchased him from a breeder in Washougal, Washington. He was about
                8 weeks old when I
                brought him home. He was very tiny at that age, but definitely a very spunky puppy.</p>
            <p>Sammy displayed a lot of the traditional Cavalier personality traits.
                He was very affectionate and loved meeting new people, but also very very attached to me. He wanted
                to be with me 24/7 and had separation anxiety. This made it hard for him to
                sleep anywhere other than on my bed at night.
            </p>

            <p>
                As Sammy got older, he loved going on walks, going to parks, and
                joining me on hikes or camping. One of his favorite places was a farm that also served as a park.
                This was a fun place for dogs to explore since they could meet the farm animals.
                Interestingly, Sammy actually didn't like other dogs and much preferred people. Luckily, people really
                loved him since he was
                so sweet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, Sammy had health problems commonly associated with the breed and
                did not live as long as I would have liked. He passed away shortly after his 8th birthday.
                He most likely suffered from heart issues that were undiagnosed.
            </p>
            <p>I would recommend a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel to someone looking for a new dog.
                They are definitely the sweetest breed I have come across. However, it's important to
                be aware of their health issues and separation anxiety.
