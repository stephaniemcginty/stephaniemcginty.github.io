            <p>I purchased Sammy (Sampson) from a breeder in Washougal, Washington. He was about 8 weeks old when I
                brought him home.
                He was very tiny at that age, but definitely a very spunky puppy.</p>
            <p>Sammy displayed a lot of the traditional Cavalier personality traits.
                He was very affectionate and loved meeting new people, but also very very attached to me. He wanted
                to be with me 24/7 and had separation anxiety. This made it hard for him to
                sleep anywhere other than on my bed at night. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As Sammy got older, he loved going on walks, going to parks, and
                joining me on hikes or camping. One of his favorite places was a farm that also served as a park.Interestingly, Sammy actually didn't like other
                dogs and much preferred people. Luckily, people really loved him since he was
                such a sweet dog.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, Sammy had health problems commonly associated with the breed and
                did not live as long as I would have liked. He passed away shortly after his 8th birthday.
